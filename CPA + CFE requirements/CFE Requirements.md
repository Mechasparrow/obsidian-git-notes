Fraud is constantly evolving. Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) need to stay current in the profession by completing Continuing Professional Education (CPE). CFEs must obtain a minimum of 20 CPE credits each year; at least 10 of these must relate directly to the detection and deterrence of fraud and 2 must relate directly to ethics.
