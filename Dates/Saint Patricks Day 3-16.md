The day **commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, and celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general**. Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, céilithe, and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks

According to tradition, Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the [pagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_polytheism "Celtic polytheism") Irish to Christianity. The _Declaration_ says that he spent many years evangelising in the northern half of Ireland and converted thousands.

Patrick's efforts were eventually turned into an allegory in which he drove "snakes" out of Ireland, despite the fact that snakes were not known to inhabit the region

Essentially it is about suspending Lent for a day.
