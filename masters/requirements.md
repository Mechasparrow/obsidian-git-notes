-   Transcripts from every school you attended for academic credit; if the transcript is not in English, we require English translations.
-   Recommendations from those who can authoritatively discuss your Computer Science skills (friends, family, and co-workers are not good recommenders) - see [our guidelines](http://omscs.gatech.edu/additional-app-guidelines) on preparing a strong application.
-   Name of your employer (Employment page).
-   Resume - required no matter your background.  Resume can be uploaded on the [Application Documents](https://gradapp.gatech.edu/apply/frm?abdebb76-b6e6-4724-b01c-1b83c31f13d0) page.
-   Specific supporting information of your CS-related background, skills, and capabilities; remember, we encourage and admit applicants from many non-traditional (i.e., non-CS or related) backgrounds. Summarize and explain succinctly in the Background section below what CS background, skills, and capabilities make you able to perform ACADEMICALLY rigorous CS graduate level work. Upload into the Professional Development area of the application any appropriate supporting documents (except transcripts which should be uploaded into the Academic History area).
